Flickr only has photos. It's pretty good, but I'd like to be able to study other peoples art as well. So bing or something would be nicer, but flickr is good for now.

It returns non integer numbers of images! This is wrong.

It seems I need to be capturing the keys a user presses before they alter the state of the time in the time fields...


This is cool:

I love this:

Probably phantomjs on python is still better. Idk.
Depends on

Possably very useful for writing a user side search api

This is a thing I want to do, but better:
https://github.com/Daio-io/pixplorer-ingester
http://api.pixplorer.co.uk/

I don't even know what this is:

Possible sources for images:
Has api:

https://www.flickr.com/services/api/
Not more than 30 images per page... I don't know if that's ok.
Ok, it's flickr! I'll try to limit images per page in some way, I think that's just a formality for not using too much bandwidth.
The licensing doesn't look that bad once I've read more into it. I like:
"This product uses the Flickr API but is not endorsed or certified by Flickr."

https://developers.shutterstock.com/
Hos "shutterstock" watermarked on pictures.
A think it has to be shutterstock, assuming their request policy is in any way better than flicrs.
It's not.

https://pixabay.com/api/docs/
Kinda bad.
I *really* like thier lisensing speal, but there's not enough images.

http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/
good.
I like the resources availiable, but can't find documentation of rate limits.
Legal mumbo jumbo looks bad.
Had some nice images, but only 2 for wolfsbane.

https://services.tineye.com/TinEyeAPI
Not the kind of image search I want. Seems exclusively reverse image.

https://www.splashbase.co/api
Bad.

bad.

Maybe api:
